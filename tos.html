You may not: modify or copy the Services; use the Services for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial), including but not limited to: accessing, retrieving or indexing the Services for purposes of constructing or populating a searchable database of contact or business information; recording, processing, or mining information about other users; or using any robot, spider, search/retrieval application, or other automated device, process or means to access, retrieve, scrape, or index the Services or any content; attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the App; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server. All licenses granted herein to you shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by SpendTime at any time for these reasons or for any other reason at the discretion of SpendTime. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Content:</strong></h2>
<p>To create and use your account, you may choose to provide us with information, or access to information, such as email, notes, files, reminders, calendar, phone, messaging, contacts, photos, social media and other content (collectively, “<b>your content</b>”). You own your content and may request deletion of your content at any time, unless you have shared your content with others and they have not deleted it, or it was copied or stored by other users while displayed by you to others through the Services, as further described in our Privacy Policy. In order to host your information within the Service and provide the associated benefits of using the Service, you grant us and our service providers a nonexclusive, worldwide, transferrable right to copy, modify and use your content to provide the Services subject to our Privacy Policy. You represent and warrant that you have the right to provide us with your content and to permit us to use and disclose your content within the parameters authorized by these Terms or our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining and protecting a separate permanent record of all of your content. SpendTime will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your content, or for backing up or restoring any of your content.</p>
<h2><strong>Payment:</strong></h2>
<p>You shall pay all fees or charges (“<b>Fees</b>”) to your account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a Fee is due and payable. By providingSpendTime and/or our Third-Party Service Provider with your payment information, you agree that SpendTime and/or our Third-Party Service Provider is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all Fees due and payable to SpendTime hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You shall immediately notify SpendTime of any change in your payment information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. SpendTime reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods in its sole discretion. You agree to have sufficient funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure that the purchase price is collectible by us. Your failure to provide accurate payment information to SpendTime and/or our Third-Party Service Provider or our inability to collect payment constitutes your material breach of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all Fees for the Service are non-refundable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a) Third-Party Service Provider.</strong> SpendTime uses [Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates] as its third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (“<strong>Third-Party Service Provider</strong>”). If you make a purchase on the Service, you will be required to provide your payment details and any additional information required to complete your order directly to our ThirdParty Service Provider. [You agree to be bound by [Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/ssa)] and hereby consent and authorize SpendTime and [Stripe] to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more Third-Party Service Provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.] Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our Third-Party Service Provider and your card issuer, and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our Third-Party Service Provider uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Third-Party Service Provider may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b) Subscriptions.</strong> If you purchase access to certain features and functionality of the Services on a time-limited basis (a “<strong>Subscription</strong>”), the Fee for such Subscription (“<strong>Service Subscription Fee</strong>”) will be billed at the start of the Subscription (“<strong>Subscription Service Commencement Date</strong>”) and at regular intervals in accordance with your elections at the time of purchase. SpendTime reserves the right to change the timing of our billing. SpendTime reserves the right to change the Subscription pricing at any time in accordance with the Section titled “Modifications” below. If changes to the Subscription price occur that impact your Subscription, SpendTime will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you, such as by sending an email to the email address associated with your account. If you do not agree with such changes, you may cancel your Subscription as set forth in Sections titled “Cancelling Subscriptions Purchased via SpendTime” or “Cancelling Subscriptions Purchased via a Third-Party Application Store”. SpendTime is not obligated to provide the Service to you until SpendTime accepts your order by a confirmatory email or other appropriate means of communication.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal</span>. If you elect to purchase a Subscription, your Subscription will continue and automatically renew at SpendTime’s thencurrent price for such Subscription until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. The frequency at which your Subscription renews (i.e., weekly, monthly, annually, etc.) will be designated at the time at you sign up for the Subscription and may be modified by you via your account settings. By subscribing, you authorize SpendTime to charge the payment method designated in your account now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent Subscription period. Upon renewal of your Subscription, if SpendTime does not receive payment, (i) you shall pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and/or (ii) you agree that SpendTime may either terminate or suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your designated payment method until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new Subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>

If you cancel your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of your then-current Subscription term; your Subscription will not be renewed after your thencurrent term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Service Subscription Fee paid for the thencurrent Subscription period.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>f)</strong> You and SpendTime acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>
